# Meme-Generator
(First React Project with API)
This is my first project built with React and integrated with an API. It's a simple meme generator that allows users to add custom text to random meme images.

The app fetches meme images from the Imgflip API and lets users add their own top and bottom text. When the user clicks the button, a new meme image is loaded, and the text remains intact.

Features:

Fetches random meme images from the Imgflip API.
Allows users to add custom text (top and bottom) to the meme image.
Button to load a new meme image without refreshing the page.
